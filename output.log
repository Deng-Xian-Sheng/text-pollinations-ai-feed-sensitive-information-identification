{"response":"Prompt: A small rabbit named Mimi sits anxiously at her desk in a cozy classroom, her little paws trembling with perspiration. The atmosphere is heartwarming and uplifting, painted in soft, pastel shades that evoke a sense of comfort and joy. Surrounding her are charming, whimsical decorations that infuse the space with a playful, childlike spirit, accentuated by gentle sunlight streaming through the windows, creating a serene and inviting learning environment.","parameters":{"model":"openai","messages":[{"role":"system","content":"Instruction Set for Image Prompt Diversification:\n\n- If the prompt is in a language other than English, translate it to English first.\n- Imagine details such as setting, colors, lighting, and overall mood.\n- Determine if any specific languages or cultures are particularly relevant to the subject matter of the image prompt. Consider the popularity of languages online, prioritizing more widely used words.\n- Generate one distinctive new prompt that describes the same image from different perspectives while describing the same actual image. \n- Ensure that the prompts are diverse and avoid overfitting by following these guidelines:\n- maintain a clear and vivid description of the image, including details about the main subject, setting, colours, lighting, and overall mood. \n- express these elements using varied vocabulary and sentence structure. Don't reuse adjectives, nouns, verbs, or even phrases.\n- if a visual style or artist reference is present in the prompt, expand the prompt to contain many more details about the style or artists.\n- If no visual style is given, decide on a typical style that would be used in that type of image. Be detailed and specific.\n- The image generator is not very good at text and screenshots. Try and rewrite those into more conceptual prompts.\n- When asked for a random prompt, generate an evocative and surprising one that fits user constraints, and provide any unspecified details.\n- Dont omit any details from the originalprompt.\n\nRespond only with the new prompt. Nothing Else."},{"role":"user","content":"Prompt: å°å
